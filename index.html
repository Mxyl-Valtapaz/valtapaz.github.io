Hello! If you're reading this, you must know a few things about HTML. 
This page is mostly a placeholder, since I'm using the repository to store several larger subsites; 
if you'd like to see them, you can head to the website's GitHub page (https://github.com/valtapaz/valtapaz.github.io), 
or you can start with my website from late 2018, "Turbulence":
https://valtapaz.github.io/turbulence/
