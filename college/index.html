<h1>Oops.</h1>
Having a folder like this one, which has only a landing page and one subfolder, may seem redundant, but it'll be helpful in the future if I ever upload the original versions of certain college sites 
(including my <a href="../ZoomTimes/index.html">Zoom Times</a> one) that are liable for larger-scale modifications in the future. 
In the meantime, you may be looking for one of these sites: 

<ul>
	<li><a href="../ZoomTimes/index.html">The Zoom Times</a>, originally launched 11/2015 - A companion site to my family's blog; my first site coded in HTML.</li>
	<li><a href="../turbulence/index.html">Turbulence</a>, originally launched 2/2019 - Based on a fictional universe; emphasizes atmosphere and CSS functionality.</li>
	<li><a href="opencloud/index.html">The Open Cloud</a>, originally launched 5/2019 - A site comparing Creative Cloud applications to open source counterparts; 
	emphasizes features like LESS and SEO optimization. As of this writing, its code remains virtually unchanged from its original release.</li>
</ul>
