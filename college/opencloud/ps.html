<h1>The GIMP</h1>
<p>
It isn't a surprise that this program is the one that challenges what many regard as the definitive image manipulation tool. 
<a href="https://gimp.org" title="The GIMP Official Website" target="_blank">GIMP</a>, or the GNU Image Manipulation Program, 
almost prides itself on being a free and open source Photoshop alternative. But how does the program actually stack up? 
<span id="about"></span></p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
First launched in 1996, GIMP has grown from a slow-to-load, somewhat awkward multi-windowed program into a well-featured program that easily holds up on its own. 
While it can run a little slow when using large brush sizes, it's remarkably stable, enough so that one could potentially even associate it with proprietary software, 
if not for its cartoon-character logo and its extraordinary range of customization options. 
</p>
<h2 id="replacement">As a Replacement...</h2>
<p>
GIMP and Photoshop are reasonably similar, although their methods of getting to places are somewhat different. Both programs tend to assume that you know what you're doing, 
and neither one comes with the assumption that you're more familiar with the other. The largest difference is that GIMP treats Photoshop's near-default Transform tool, 
used by the easy-to-reach V key, is replaced by the Unified Transform Tool, hidden in the middle of the toolbox and reached using Shift+T 
(notably, as with Photoshop's CC 2019 update, scaling is automatically proportionate here). 
The tradeoff, however, is that the Unified Transform Tool can also be used in place of the Shear and Perspective tools. 
Accessing the GIMP's filters is virtually the same process as it is in Photoshop (Menu Bar / Filter), even if GIMP lacks Photoshop's photo gallery, 
and several of Photoshop's tools are carried over fairly directly. <span id="downsides"></span>
</p>
<h2>Downsides</h2>
<p>
The main issue where GIMP fails to kick off on is nondestructive editing. 
Like Photoshop, it does include opacity masks, but beyond that its lack of nondestructive tools can be a harrowing experience for those used to Photoshop: 
smart objects, layer effects and even adjustment layers aren't currently supported, meaning that any changes to a layer (including scaling it down) are effectively permanent. 
Fortunately, all three of these features are listed in <a href="https://wiki.gimp.org/wiki/Roadmap" target="_blank">GIMP's official roadmap page</a> 
(apparently they have to finish porting the program to the <a href="https://gegl.org/" target="_blank">GEGL</a> graphics library for it to work), 
though it'll probably be a while until we see some of them implemented. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps more frustrating is the fact that only one layer can be selected at a time. While I'm certain one can attempt to fix this with layer groups, 
this hasn't worked very well for me and can still turn problematic at times. 
This, combined with the lack of adjustment layers, makes it very difficult to work with multiple layers: 
adjusting the color of an overall image would require merging all the layers and applying a color correction effect over the image in general 
(I tried to fake this using a group, though apparently layer groups don't support color correction). 
</p>
<p>
On top of this, some may draw attention to its lack of CMYK support; while this isn't an issue for me (and recent updates to the program have been helping on this end), 
it will be one for anyone working in the print medium, so how that affects the workflow will vary based on what the program's being used for. 
A minor qualm is also that the program's custom Open window feels a little inconvenient, but this doesn't actually affect the workflow itself. <span id="advantages"></span>
</p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>
Despite these sour notes, GIMP actually surpasses Photoshop at one particular point: selection. 
GIMP's lasso tool combines the Polygonal Lasso and standard Lasso tools from Photoshop, 
enabling one to click and drag in a freehand manner and click multiple times in a polygonal manner with the same selection, which I found an extraordinary time saver. 
The marquee and elipse selection tool offer their own twist on selection: immediately after making a circlular or rectangular selection, 
one can scale the selection similar to how one would scale a layer. 
</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>
GIMP is an extremely powerful editor that's come a long way within the last several years, and it's looking like it'll improve more as time goes on. 
I presume the question for most will be whether the price is worth the lack of adjustment layers and smart objects; 
one can keep an unmodified duplicate around in the meantime, but GIMP is ultimately a fantastic (if a little limited) tool. <span id="media"></span>
</p>
<h2>Media</h2>
<p>
Here are two videos showing me making a basic image in both Gimp and Photoshop. 
Most of the footage is real time, though both videos are clipped and sped a little at some points to show how someone more familiar with each program would do it 
(notably, as I have a relatively large amount of experience in Photoshop, the time I took on each doesn't necessarily mean that one program is more time-efficient than the other).

<p>
The videos show the same function: compositing a lens flare image and a sparks image with an addative blending mode onto an image of a forest, 
then color grading each layer with a Curves adjustment. GIMP's lack of adjustment layers and other multi-layer tools becomes sorely apparent here 
(although it thankfully saves recently used Curves adjustments, allowing one to load them), 
although Photoshop's separate lasso tools are left far behind by GIMP's combined freehand/polygonal tool. 
Oddly enough, I was having an issue with GIMP's eraser tool not working on layers, forcing me to use masking instead; 
I haven't particularly seen this error before, although an online article noted that reinstalling the program can fix it.
