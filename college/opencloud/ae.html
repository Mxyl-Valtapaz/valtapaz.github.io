<h1>Blender</h1>
<p>
Are we really going there? Are we actually going to compare a 3D modeling/animation program to a VFX compositor? Yup. 
We're comparing <a href="https://blender.org/" title="Blender's Official Website" target="_blank">Blender</a>, of all things, with After Effects. 
<span id="about"></span></p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Created in January of 1998, Blender started off as a modeling and animation program. 
Since then, it's stretched its wings into nearly anything media-related imaginable&mdash;including compositing. 
</p>
<h2 id="replacement">As a Replacement...</h2>
<!--<p>
First off: why are we even comparing these two programs? Shouldn't I be comparing <a href="https://natrongithub.github.io/ target="_blank">Natron</a> and Blender? 
</p>-->
<p>
Despite its awkward initial purpose, Blender is actually quite capable with compositing: it does masking, it does keying, and perhaps most impressively, it does motion tracking. 
Blender's website claims that VFX professionals call its VFX side &ldquo;probably the best tracker in the market.&rdquo; 
While I'm not sure where the quote comes from, Blender's tracker backs this up the claim: its tracking can gives amazing results, and compositing 3D onto real-life footage has never been easier. 
Blender also allows for a limited amount of video editing, color correction and other features that After Effects also has plenty of.
<span id="downsides"></span>
</p>
<h2>Downsides</h2>
<p>
Blender is not After Effects. If you want to replicate just about any specific feature from Adobe's Effects list (particularly anything that appears under Generate), you will probably be disappointed. 
It's sad, but it's true. Additionally, buffering video would be an appreciated addition. 
<span id="advantages"></span></p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>
I remember when Adobe's website boasted about &ldquo;Real 3D in After Effects.&rdquo; Blender, being first and foremost a 3D-leaning program, obviously gives this a run for its money. 
</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>
I wouldn't expect Blender to replace After Effects&mdash;if you're an independant VFX filmmaker who's a fan of fractal noise effects or similar things, 
I'd actually suggest staying with AE. WIth that said, for just about anyone using it for more casual purposes, from removing a green background to tracking a 3D title onto video footage, 
Blender should do the job just fine.
