<h1>About the Webmaster</h1>
<p>
Tom Pavlat is an independent web designer/developer who specializes in updating websites, logos and more. Tom is also a creative hobbyist, experienced in Creative Cloud programs since late 2013. 
An open source enthusiast, Tom has high hopes for its potential to match&mdash;and even surpass&mdash;propriety software. 
</p>

<h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<h2>This is a confusing name. Couldn't &ldquo;Cloud&rdquo; refer to just about anything on the Web?</h2>
<p>
Well... yes. I personally would've preferred the name &ldquo;Open Suite,&rdquo; but Adobe doesn't call its programs the Creative Suite anymore 
(and, as an alternate name, &ldquo;Creative Open&rdquo; sounds just plain bad). 
</p>

<h2>What's the point of this site?</h2>
<p>
As I'd mentioned on my home page, there are <a href="https://www.techradar.com/news/the-best-free-alternatives-to-adobe-creative-cloud">many,</a> 
<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/pictures/create-your-own-free-adobe-creative-cloud-with-free-and-open-source-software/">many,</a> 
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1klOx1AyPw">many,</a> 
<!--<a href="https://lifehacker.com/build-your-own-adobe-creative-suite-with-free-and-cheap-5976725">many,</a>-->
<i><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170101212823/http://ctlt.illinoisstate.edu/technology/adobe/">many</a></i> resources that list free and even open source alternatives for the Creative Cloud, 
though few of them (if any) detail exactly what makes them good alternatives, or which features they're lacking, or even anything they may have that even Adobe's programs don't have. 
My site is aimed toward anyone deciding on whether to make the switch, 
enabling them to judge on their own terms whether the Cloud is still worth the price while giving them all the information they'll need to know on its alternative programs. 
</p>

<h2>Not to complain, but there are only four programs here.</h2>
<p>
Well, yeah. As this started out a college project with a scrict deadline, this site isn't currently very big, let alone all-encompassing. 
With that said, I hope to make vast leaps in the future, eventually comprising a vast amount of the Creative Cloud, perhaps with multiple alternatives for each program.
</p>
<h2>How big will the site get?</h2>
<p>
That ultimately depends on how much experience I'll gain with Creative Cloud programs and their alternatives. 
I'm planning on skipping the mobile apps, although I would only consider the site &ldquo;complete&rdquo; once it lists alternatives for all the major Adobe programs, including Animate and Dreamweaver. 
Of course, that won't necessarily be the end&mdash;technology is a changing field, and as major updates for programs' alternatives are released, 
revisions to my pages will become necessary. 
</p>
<h2>Finally, which programs did you use to make your site's assets?</h2>
<p>
Y'know, I started out designing the background in Photoshop, but then I just stopped midway through. There was no way I was going to be able to live with the irony. 
</p>
<p>
All images for this site were created using GIMP and Inkscape, while all video on the site was made using Olive or a combination of it and Kdenlive. 
This actually helped immensely in gathering information on the features, abilities and potential drawbacks of the programs. 
</p>
<!--<h2>Why open source, not just free?</h2>
<p>
If budget is your only concern, it may seem confusing why to distunguish open source software from other products that are freely available; 
however, open source programs tend to have a leg up against their generically free competition in several ways: 
</p>
<h2>Community</h2>
<p>
Generic freeware is much like open source software in terms of price, but all too often it's ultimately run by a company, 
which can be both an advantage and a drawback&mdash;while there's more incentive to continue and update a project, 
the project is run by a team motivated largely by a paycheck
In contrast, open source programs can be modified by anyone, and can form an entire community of programmers who create software because they 
The power of a community can rival even the most professional of programs. 
</p>
<h3>Customizability</h3>
<p>
When you pay for a product, you have a right to use it, but you don't own it; the license of the software can and will restrain you from certain actions, 
such as decompiling or illegally sharing the program. Freeware is similar; the license allows you to use it, but only under certain conditions, which often includes not modifying the source code. 
Open source software, as the name suggests, virtually encourages the opposite, inviting users to make their own changes (and even their own contributions) as they see fit. 
For instance, if you want to modify the UI of an open source program with a custom dark theme, you can look through the program's resources and replace whichever files you want 
(or, alternatively, you can look up a tutorial and download a theme someone else made). If you wanted to do so for a propriety program like iTunes, 
that would violate the program's license agreement&mdash;and, most likely, federal law.
</p>
<h3>No Strings Attached</h3>
<p>
Open source software is meant for people. Vast numbers of free programs will often be limited via 30-day trials, watermarks or limited functionality. 
Other free programs will have all their features unlocked but require a paid license before they're used for commercial purposes, 
and still others will make the more reasonable but still not preferable request of gaining a percentage of profit from any commercial creations. 
Open source programs, on the other hand, tend to be far more lenient&mdash;I've only run into one program so far (not mentioned on this site) 
that wanted a donation before offering more advanced features. 
</p>
<h3>Fun and Innovation</h3>
<p>
Unbeknownst to most, <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>, an excellent open source media player, 
includes a feature where it scrambles parts of the video being played into an interactive puzzle game. There's little (if any) practical value to such a feature, 
but apparently, someone who knew how to code decided it would be fun if the program could do that. 
Much the same rule applies to other open source programs: if someone familiar with the programming language thinks a feature should be added, for usefulness or simply for fun, 
they have the option to add it themselves.
