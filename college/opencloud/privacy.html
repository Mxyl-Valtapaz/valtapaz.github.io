<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p>
We take user information very seriously on our site. 
While our data aggregation methods are not as aggressive as those employed by most companies, 
we still require some information to sustain and improve our website. 
</p>
<h2>Collection of Information</h2>
<p>
Our contact page requires a user's name and email to be given, which will be collected and temporarily stored afterward. 
Our site also employs Google Analytics, which gathers data about visitors' numbers, country of origin, visit frequency and which features they use most on our site. 
</p>
<h2>Usage of Information</h2>
<p>
Visitors' names and emails will be used to contact them back about question or inquiries. 
After this, we hold these items in a database for six months to determine whether users have contacted us before, after which the information is deleted permanently. 
Our Google Analytics data will be used solely to determine success and tailor our site to user needs. 
As long as this site stays online and as long as we hold your information, we will <em>never</em> sell your data.
</p>
<h2>Third Party Cookie Information</h2>
<p>
We allow some third party cookies on our site to track user navigation to use for advertising purposes; 
this data will be tailored based on the program pages viewed, such as advertising video editing programs for those seeking an alternative to programs like Premiere and After Effects, 
although this third-party information is accessible to the advertising party alone and not to us.  
Google Analytics also utilizes some cookies for purely analytical purposes, and will not be used for anything else. 
This data helps us recognize which users visit the same Webpages frequently, allowing us to improve our site. 
</p>
<h2>Cookie Policy</h2>
<p>
This website doesn't currently employ a login or purchasing system, so we currently do not use first party cookies. 
With that said, we plan to move from Google-powered cookies to our own cookie system. 
Any and all such future first party cookies will be used for exclusively analytical purposes. 
</p>
<small>Any and all information on this page is subject to change at any time.</small>
