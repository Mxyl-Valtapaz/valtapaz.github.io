<h1>Welcome to the Open Cloud!</h1>
<p>
Despite its high quality, Adobe's Creative Cloud can be extremely expensive for low-budget creators (charging prices of over $50 per month in the U.S.), 
and is currently only supported on Windows and Macintosh. At the end of the day, however, their programs can't be matched when it comes to effectiveness or efficiency... or can they? 
This site is a resource that attemtps to objectively compare Creative Cloud applications' features with those of entirely free, 
open source programs that creators can use without worrying about licensing fees, limited OS support or lack of customization. 
This resource aims to be ideal for independent creators, filmmakers on a tight budget or any Creative Cloud users considering a switch to Linux.

<h2>What is &ldquo;The Open Cloud?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>
Nearly everyone in the creative scene, be they artists, graphic designers or independent filmmakers, 
knows that the programs that comprise Adobe's Creative Cloud are <em>very</em> good at what they do. 
(If they weren't, they wouldn't be able to sustain themselves on the prices they charge.) 
However, everything has its limits, and the Creative Cloud is no exception&mdash;its programs are exclusively confined to devices running Windows and Macintosh, 
and its continuous pricing can be a nightmare (or at least a discouragement) for beginning or independent creators. 
The Open Cloud aims to gather a suite of programs that can stand up to Adobe's, with each program being free, open source and supported on nearly any operating system. 
</p>

<h2>How does this differ from other resources?</h2>
<p>
If you're part of the open source community, you've probably heard this before. There are many articles that dig into replacements for Adobe's Creative Suite, 
in addition to YouTube channels and other resources that give tutorials for open source creative software. 
This site aims to be different by answering some of the questions that Creative Cloud users and independent creators will want to know: 
which effects can the program replicate? Which features are missing? Is the program too incomplete or bug-ridden for any set of features to matter? 
We hope to not only offer open source alternatives to commercial programs but also to let creators know exactly what they're getting into before they make the switch. 
</p>

<h2>Why open source, not just free?</h2>
<p>
If budget is your only concern, it may seem confusing why to distinguish open source software from other products that are freely available; 
however, open source programs tend to have a leg up against their generically free competition in several ways: 
</p>
<!--<h2>Community</h2>
<p>
Generic freeware is much like open source software in terms of price, but all too often it's ultimately run by a company, 
which can be both an advantage and a drawback&mdash;while there's more incentive to continue and update a project, 
the project is run by a team motivated largely by a paycheck
In contrast, open source programs can be modified by anyone, and can form an entire community of programmers who create software because they 
The power of a community can rival even the most professional of programs. 
</p>-->
<h3>Customizability</h3>
<p>
When you pay for a product, you have a right to use it, but you don't own it; the license of the software can and will restrain you from certain actions, 
such as decompiling or illegally sharing the program. Freeware is similar; the license allows you to use it, but only under certain conditions, which often includes not modifying the source code. 
Open source software, as the name suggests, virtually encourages the opposite, inviting users to make their own changes (and even their own contributions) as they see fit. 
For instance, if you want to modify the UI of an open source program with a custom dark theme, you can look through the program's resources and replace whichever files you want 
(or, alternatively, you can look up a tutorial and download a theme someone else made). If you wanted to do so for a propriety program like iTunes, 
that would violate the program's license agreement&mdash;and, most likely, federal law.
</p>
<h3>No Strings Attached</h3>
<p>
Open source software is meant for people. Vast numbers of free programs will often be limited via 30-day trials, watermarks or limited functionality. 
Other free programs will have all their features unlocked but require a paid license before they're used for commercial purposes, 
and still others will make the more reasonable but still not preferable request of gaining a percentage of profit from any commercial creations. 
Open source programs, on the other hand, tend to be far more lenient&mdash;I've only run into one program so far (not mentioned on this site) 
that wanted a donation before offering more advanced features, in contrast to the vast number of freemium programs that employ similar tactics. 
</p>
<h3>Fun and Innovation</h3>
<p>
Unbeknownst to most, <a href="https://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html">VLC</a>, an excellent open source media player, 
includes a feature where it scrambles parts of the video being played into an interactive puzzle game. There's little (if any) practical value to such a feature, 
but apparently, someone who knew how to code decided it would be fun if the program could do that. 
Much the same rule applies to other open source programs: if someone familiar with the programming language thinks a feature should be added, for usefulness or simply for fun, 
they have the option to add it themselves.
