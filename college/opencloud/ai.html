<h1>Inkscape</h1>
<p>
Often viewed as the hands-down definitive alternative to Illustrator, 
<a href="https://inkscape.org/" title="Inkscape's Official Website" target="_blank">Inkscape</a> feels like one of the most complete alternatives to date, 
perhaps even more so here than GIMP is to Photoshop. 
<span id="about"></span></p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
First released in 2003, Inkscape looks like a very basic editor while hiding some pretty powerful features. 
Another extraordinarily stable program, Inkscape is capable of importing just about any file and offers a fantastic suite of tools. 
</p>
<h2 id="replacement">As a Replacement...</h2>
<p>
To kick things off, Inkscape is capable of importing Illustrator files to a limited extent, 
which could be called a dig at Adobe or a gesture to anyone who downloads a .AI file without a program to modify it. 
Its default keyboard shortcuts are rather awkward (its toolbox requires keys ranging from M to F3 to Ctrl+F2), 
though its preferences go even further in acknowledging or antagonizing Adobe by offering the option to have its keyboard shortcuts follow Illustrator's 
(CS2's, at least). The essentials (such as a pen tool and gradients) are all there, along with some more advanced features like symbols. 
<span id="downsides"></span>
</p>
<h2>Downsides</h2>
<p>
Inkscape works in SVG, and this is both a strength and a flaw; unfortunately, 
<a href="http://wiki.inkscape.org/wiki/index.php/Multipage" title="the Inkscape wiki on multiple artboards">as Inkscape's wiki explains</a>, 
multiple artboards (known in Inkscape as pages) don't currently exist in SVG and therefore can't be in Inkscape either. 
The program also lacks a color picker at the level of GIMP's or an Adobe program's, and this notably lowers the experience for me.
</p>
<p>Inkscape also doesn't have a dark theme by default, but those in the community have contributed such themes on their own&mdash;one reason why I particularly like open source software.
<span id="advantages"></span>
</p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>
To be honest: load times. Inkscape doesn't even need a loading screen, instead fully loading on my computer within 6 seconds flat. 
Since most of my vector work is relatively simple, I'd been used to waiting on Adobe's wait times for quite a long time, so this came as a massive relief. 
Especially if you use a lower end PC, this is extremely convenient and definitely shouldn't be dismissed under the fact that it doesn't impact workflow. 
</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>
Inkscape isn't complete, per se, but from opacity masks to text tools, it's come pretty close. 
Combining extremely fast loading times with powerful functionality, I've made Inkscape my go-to vector editing program even with my access to the Creative Cloud.
