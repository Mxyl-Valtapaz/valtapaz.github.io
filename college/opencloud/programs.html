<!--<h2>Well, that list feels a little redundant.</h2>
<p>
This site is in its early stages, so its list currently isn't distinct from that of the homepage. 
However, the more this site grows, the more different this will become: the list here would ideally grow into a full table of programs, each with a page detailing replacements or alternatives for them. 
</p>-->

<h2>Format</h2>
<p>
These program pages will tend to vary a little, but they'll generally go through a few major headings: 
</p>
<h3>About</h3>
<p>
An introduction to the program at large, when it was made, and its general features; to a degree, this may include a cursory evaluation of its overall quality. 
</p>
<h3>&ldquo;As a Replacement&rdquo;</h3>
<p>
This more general section compares the program's features to its respective Creative Cloud app; this aims to highlight the differences in how each program may go about doing the same tasks 
and overviewing their general quality. 
</p>
<h3>Downsides</h3>
<p>
Perhaps the most useful section for those considering switching, this goes over the more significant points of what Creative Cloud users won't be able to do. 
Some CC programs date back as far as the late 1980s and have recieved fairly consistent feature updates since then, 
so it's little surprise that not all open source software has reached the point that the Creative Cloud has (yet). 
</p>
<h3>Advantages?</h3>
<p>
If I've found any points that the alternative excels&mdash;and even surpasses its presumed superiors&mdash;at, I'll be sure to list them here. 
</p>
<h3>The Bottom Line</h3>
<p>
In essence, what most people came to this site to hear answered: is it a worthy replacement? Will it serve their needs? 
To some degree this will depend on what the user wants to do, and my pages hope to acknowledge that.
