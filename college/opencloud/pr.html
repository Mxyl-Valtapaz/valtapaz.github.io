<h1>Kdenlive</h1>
<p>
<a href="http://kdenlive.org/" target="_blank">Kdenlive</a> is probably one of the most advanced and modern open source video editors around. 
Its features are remarkable, but working with the program raises one question: does it actually work? 
<span id="about"></span></p>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>
Kdenlive was made in 2002 as a non-linear video editor. It draws from several libraries to strengthen its abilities, 
supporting various file formats with the help of <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/" target="_blank">FFmpeg</a> 
and acheiving a variety of visual effects via the <a href="https://frei0r.dyne.org/" target="_blank">Frei0r effects</a> pack. 
</p>
<h2 id="replacement">As a Replacement...</h2>
<p>
Kdenlive is actually fairly capable editor. Both it and Premiere will snap clips together, which is essential when it comes to working with individual frames. 
Perhaps the largest difference when simply moving clips of footage is that a moving clip in Kdenlive will actually stop at the edge of another clip in the same layer&mdash;a strong contrast to Premiere, 
which will have any clip that's moved to a given area &ldquo;eat&rdquo; any piece of footage in its way. 
Whether that qualifies as a feature or a bug depends on how annoying or helpful Premiere's &ldquo;eating&rdquo; is. 
<span id="downsides"></span>
</p>
<h2>Downsides</h2>
<p>
Perhaps the biggest issue is that Kdenlive is that it isn't very stable, at least on Windows. 
At some points Kdenlive has crashed, and at other points even a simple Fade In effect didn't work (although, admittedly, I don't know how much of that is my own inexperience with the program). 
The lack of keyframes also serves as a problem; I feel keyframing an opacity setting would be far easier than attempting to use Fade In as an effect, 
but then again perhaps I'm just used to the way Premiere works. I've heard that Kdenlive is far stable on Linux, although I haven't tried it on that. 
<span id="advantages"></span></p>
<h2>Advantages</h2>
<p>
As with Inkscape, the load time on Kdenlive is extremely fast. Its Frei0r effects actually allow it to do some things that are associated more with After Effects than Premiere 
(such as a stylized pixelation or distorted corners effect) although Premiere itself still has a few of these on a deeper look. 
</p>
<h2>The Bottom Line</h2>
<p>
Kdenlive isn't the most stable program, but for the time being it's a pretty good alternative. 
I'd certainly trust it, even if it isn't quite where Premiere is, though some patience may be required. 
<span id="other"></span>
</p>
<h2>Other Options?</h2>
<p>
<a href="https://www.olivevideoeditor.org/" target="_blank">Olive Editor</a> is an extremely new video editor (its earliest sign of development only dates back to February of 2018!) 
that nonetheless looks quite promising. Looking from the ground up like it was made to be a Premiere replacement, its keyboard shortcuts, 
tool aesthetics and even UI to a degree are remarkably similar to Premiere's (somewhat alarmingly so, in fact). 
It isn't anywhere near stable, as the developer himself admitted (with saving and loading being a particular offender as of April '19), 
and its effects are soemwhat lacking (especially in terms of color), 
but it looks like it could shape up to be a remarkable program, and I'll be very interested in whether it could surpass Kdenlive with the progress it's made so far.
</p>
<p>
And then, of course, we have <a href="https://blender.org" target="_blank">Blender</a>. It may have not been made for video editing and may have a higher learning curge than other free video editors, 
but it can get the job done, it's stable and it <em>works</em>. If being as certain as possibly that the project will render is number one on your priority list, I'd recommend simply going with this.
