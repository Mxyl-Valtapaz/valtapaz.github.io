The</span> Supernatural and Advanced Science and Technology Investigation program was initiated in 1989 by the global organization known as Metal Project, 
with the established purpose of monitoring--and, if necessary, interfering with--the activities of beings with uncanny abilities.  
Humans utilizing abilities outside the plane of human understanding and creating technology 
decades--if not centuries--ahead of our time had become slowly more common since the first instances became noticed by Metal Project in the 1920s, 
and the situation had grown far enough that a new branch was formed to deal with the potential threat: SASTI.
</p>

<p class=t><span class=t1>
SASTI</span> was intentionally disassociated from its parent organization.  
President Reagan's having stripped the NSA of its anonymity left Metal Project paranoid enough to be as sure as possible that 
any revelation of SASTI's existence wouldn't necessarily mean the end of Metal Project's secrecy.  
As a result, SASTI was made to appear to be as independent as possible, with its own organized hierarchy.  
When the third leader of SASTI, who went by the codename "Shade," took up the role in 1994, 
he saw several inherent weaknesses and limitations of the program that severely impaired SASTI's ability to solve the superhuman crisis, 
built into SASTI by Metal Project itself. 
Taking advantage of the system and of SASTI's secretly growing forces, 
he began a civil war within Metal Project that ended in SASTI all but completely severing itself from its parent organization, 
having grown entirely out of Metal Project's hands.  Threatening to reveal Metal Project to the world should they object, 
SASTI went on, speeding up the production of its projects.  
</p>

<p class=t><span class=t1>
Without</span> a force to inhibit them, SASTI soon turned to more effective means of dealing with the crisis.  
Various studies had revealed that virtually all instances of stranger powers and technological might had at some point been used against humanity, 
with many users of such technology turning dangerous, and even murderous.  For the sake of humanity, SASTI could not let this continue.  
Whenever an extranatural or unnaturally ingenious threat would be found, such a threat was to be neutralized by whichever means were deemed necessary.  

</p>

<p class=t><span class=t1>
SASTI</span> have even expanded their projects beyond these beings, into areas that would normally be taken on by Metal Project 
(which, although it still exists, is not nearly the hidden global empire that it was before SASTI); 
it has searched for and located objects potentially related to extraterrestrial life or even time travel, 
and has also worked to a degree on mysterious lights that would sometimes be seen on horizons.<br><br>
