Work</span> on #248 has officially begun. The multi-purpose AI system stands out from recent builds on the grounds that it 
will be capable of utilizing human and abnatural DNA to discover new cases across the Earth, allowing SASTI to intercept them before any harm is done. 
In addition to revolutionizing our investigation processes, 
it will speed up communication by allowing any two members of similar DNA to communicate with their thoughts alone. 
Beta tests on this feature have proven disastrous thus far, 
although research suggests that switching subjects from rats to humans will yield far more effective results. 
As of this writing, further research continues.

SASTI</span> would like to formally repeat: any men or women dressed entirely in black are NOT to be followed or socialized with. 
Many of these beings claim to follow an organization based in Abydos, Egypt, and have made numerous impedements regarding #36 and Horizon research. 
It is currently under debate whether the members of this organization are human or superhuman, 
although evidence to date suggests a third subcategory between the two. Should any of our members of SASTI encounter these members, 
they should stay away from them and only shoot should they attempt to interfere with SASTI operations.

Work on #36</span> is complete. It will be deployed upon the discretion of SHADE.

As of this date,</span> SASTI has accelerated plans regarding #131. The technology behind the device is clearly not of contemporary human origin, 
and is also unlikely to be AST technology, unless such work on biological technology has surpassed even that of SASTI. 
Damaged portions of #131 have been filled in with human DNA, the closest match found for the technology contained in the device, 
and it appears to have been designed to be mounted on a human-sized arm. Research thus far indicate implications for use as advanced weaponry. 
As of this writing, however, work continues to to divine the true nature and original purpose of the device.

The</span> Superhuman and Advanced Science and Technology Investigation program 
is proud to accounce the end of the reign of terror subjected by Garanor the destroyer, 
the self-hyperpowered serial killer responsible in part for the demise of SH4DE, prior leader of SASTI. 
Superhuman crises such as those displayed by Garanor remind us to never let our guard down on abnatural matters, 
especially concerning those who would technologically enhance themselves to superhuman status,
and to always remember that our actions alone are keeping our world safe from the creatures at the doorstep of the Earth.
