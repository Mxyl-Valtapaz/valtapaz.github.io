<p><b>Changelog of the Website</b></p></header>
<div>
<p class=whitetext><span class=tab>Welcome</span> to the site changelog! 
This log mostly documents major changes to the site, be they under the hood or graphics-related, so more minor updates to the site's text may not be listed.<br><br></p>
<ul>
<li>09/17/17 - No major visual or functional changes, but the site now passes the W3C validation! 
In layman terms, this means the site can be read more easily by any web browser without internal errors that could cause problems with the page's appearance. 
Additionally, this makes the general coding more professional, lets search engines find the site more readily, and gives the browsers a smoother experience to work with.</li>
<li>06/26/17 - Another update, this time with a visual difference! 
The site logo and favicon are now much smoother thanks to anti-aliased recreations, and several pictures of the Zoomlians have been revised with more up to date versions. 
Finally, the site now has its own changelog! </li>
<li>03/25/17 - Despite keeping the same visuals, the new Zoomlian website recieves its first major update! 
This update mostly features under-the-hood improved navigation with shorter URLs and a move to the more reliable GitHub, though it also includes a few minor updates to the Zoomlians' pages. 
Further documentation can be found <a href="https://zoomtimes.blogspot.com/2017/05/guest-blog-by-mxyl-oops2.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>12/03/15 - The website moves to a new location after an error with the first. Throughout the next year, minor text updates concerning the Zoomlians and their hobbies have followed. 
Further documentation can be found <a href="https://zoomtimes.blogspot.com/2015/12/guest-blog-by-mxyl-oops.html">here</a>.</li>
<li>11/24/15 - The official website launches as a school project, based primarily around the Zoomlian family and their hobbies. 
Further documentation can be found <a href="https://zoomtimes.blogspot.com/2015/11/because-you-cant-get-enough.html">here</a>.</li></ul></div>
