<b>Changelog of the Website</b></p></header>
<div>
<p class=whitetext><span class=tab>Welcome</span> to the site changelog! 
This log mostly documents major changes to the site, be they under the hood or graphics-related, so more minor updates to the site's text may not be listed.<br><br></p>
<p><ul>
<li>06/26/17 - Another update, this time with a visual difference! 
The site logo and favicon are now much smoother thanks to anti-aliased recreations, and several pictures of the Zoomlians have been revised with more up to date versions. 
Finally, the site now has its own changelog! </li><br>
<li>03/25/17 - Despite keeping the same visuals, the new Zoomlian website recieves its first major update! 
This update mostly features under-the-hood improved navigation with shorter URLs and a move to the more reliable GitHub, though it also includes a few minor updates to the Zoomlians' pages. 
Further documentation can be found <a href="https://zoomtimes.blogspot.com/2017/05/guest-blog-by-mxyl-oops2.html">here</a>.</li><br>
<li>12/03/15 - The website moves to a new location after an error with the first. Throughout the next year, minor text updates concerning the Zoomlians and their hobbies have followed. 
Further documentation can be found <a href="https://zoomtimes.blogspot.com/2015/12/guest-blog-by-mxyl-oops.html">here</a>.</li><br>
<li>11/24/15 - The official website launches as a school project, based primarily around the Zoomlian family and their hobbies.
