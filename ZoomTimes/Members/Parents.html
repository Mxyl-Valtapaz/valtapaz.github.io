</p><b>The Founders of the Zoomlian Empire</b></header>
<div><p>Known by many names, including the Emperor and Prime Minister of the Zoomlian Empire, 
these two are the founders of both <a href=https://zoomtimes.blogspot.com>the <i>Zoom Times</i> blog</a> and the Zoomlian Empire itself.
  They use a unique method of homeschooling that centers around a &ldquo;chart and compass&rdquo; approach that mixes education with fun to the degree that the two are sometimes indistinguishable.</p>
<p>Eric P, also known as the Emperor, is an English teacher at a Maryland public school. 
He's written several various works and articles, including the direct-to-Amazon book <i>Proto-Comics</i>, and is venturing into fiction writing as well. 
As a high school English teacher, he also teaches high-school English at home, starting from an age considerably younger than that of the average high schooler. 
Using this method, he's given an edge to the Zoomlians and has caused some of his children to be prospective novelists.</p>

<p>Wendy P, a former scientist, is mainly in charge of homeschooling.  
As previously mentioned, she uses a chart and compass approach, saying that &ldquo;the chart is what my kids need to know&rdquo; while &ldquo;the compass is joy.&rdquo; 
Using this method, she achieves a new, hybrid kind of homeschooling that combines a variety of traditional workbooks and DVDs with more interesting techniques,
such as decorating the house according to goelogical locations to study and <a href="https://zoomtimes.blogspot.com/2012/08/sea-week-return-of-squid.html">putting a life-size giant squid replica on the ceiling to find out exactly how big one is</a>. 
One example is below, where a short play based on Beowulf is enacted. Although the play and budget are cheap and outdated compared to contemperary Zoomlian productions, the point of the play is that it's a hidden lesson on history and culture.</p>

<p>This is just one example of the unique spin on education given by the Zoomlians.</p></div>
