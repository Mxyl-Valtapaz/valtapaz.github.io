<p>Choclo and Oob are the youngest two thanes of the Zoomlian Empire. 
Choclo, at age 14, loves to socialize, coming up with various ideas for stories and games. 
He's contributed to a number of his sister <a href="Leena.html">Leena</a>'s video projects, and has picked up an affinity for roleplaying from his brother <a href="Zorg.html">Zorg</a>. 
Not knowing the meaning of stage fright, he has taken a liking to speaking not only with friends but also to an audience, 
with both skills enabling him to become a moderator for a Minecraft-related fandom wiki. 
A creative mind at heart, Choclo specializes in crafts, making various paper constructions from armor to airplanes to his own homemade card/board game.

Oob, 12, is an avid fan of birdwatching: having stated that he wishes to see every bird in the world, he's capable of identifying a variety of birds by both appearance and call, 
even owning a cockatiel himself. 
A fan of discovery and exploration, Oob is always willing to lend a hand and will often be the first to suggest going on exercising trips like biking. 
With a love of games and an insatiable taste for garlic, these two are inseparable.
