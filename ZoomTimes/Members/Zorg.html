<p class=blacktext>&ldquo;Theorist&rdquo; is a vague term, but Zorg fits almost any definition, 
creating game-based conspiracy theories, ideas for world-building and new stories, and <s>global domination</s> alternative citizenship theories. 
Currently 18 years old, he's not only provided his siblings with the meat that becomes the basis of storylines, but has also created his own worlds, cultures, stories and mythologies. 
A fluent roleplayer (both online and tabletop), he has also formulated and contributed to rounded characters and story arcs, 
and has also helped his brother <a href=Mxyl.html>Mxyl</a> with scripting and story work for his videos.  
Having spent a full term as Senior Patrol Leader of his scout troop, Zorg is also a daring skiier and an outstanding rock climber, 
having even braved the mountains of Philmont with the best of the best among scouting. 
Strong in both body and mind, his might and creative skills are indispensable. </p>
