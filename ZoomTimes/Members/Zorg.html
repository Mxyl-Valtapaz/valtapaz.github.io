</p><b>Zorg Valtapaz, the Theorist</b><p></header>
<img class=bgimg src="../Images/ZorgTr.png" alt="Image of Zorg">
<p class=blacktext>&ldquo;Theorist&rdquo; is a vague term, but Zorg fits almost any definition, 
from fun conspiracy theories about fandom worlds to ideas for world-building and new stories to <s>global domination</s> alternative citizenship theories. 
Currently 20 years old, he's not only provided his siblings with assistance and concepts for their storylines, but has also created his own worlds, cultures, stories and mythologies. 
A fluent roleplayer (both tabletop and online), he has also formulated and contributed to rounded characters and story arcs, 
and has also helped his brother <a href=Mxyl.html>Mxyl</a> with scripting and story work for his videos.  
Having spent a full term as Senior Patrol Leader of his scout troop, Zorg is also a daring skiier and an outstanding rock climber, 
having even braved the mountains of Philmont with the best of the best among scouting. Strong in body, mind and spirit, his might and creativity are indispensable.
