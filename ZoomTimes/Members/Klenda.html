</p><b>Klenda Valtapaz, Artist and Adventuress</b><br></header>
<div>
<p>Klenda Valtapaz is a 21-year-old artist with a love of puns and writing. 
She's written a variety of stories, from fan-fictions to junior novels, some of which are co-written with her brother <a href="Mxyl.html">Mxyl</a>. 
Although she primarily enjoys drawing, from pens and pencils to charcoal to digital software, she is also proficient in oil painting, watercolor and even sculpture, 
having drawn experience from a number of college courses, over a year of a dedicated art school and her own experimentation. 
She currently contributes to the world of fandom as a member of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzByZCNIHBPiYSY8q1-Syew">BCC Crew</a>, 
and runs her own <a href="https://klenda-valtapaz.deviantart.com/">DeviantArt page</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/andie_pavlat/">Instagram page</a> documenting her art work. 
</p>
<p>In addition to art and writing, Klenda has a love of books (classic or modern) and humor.
