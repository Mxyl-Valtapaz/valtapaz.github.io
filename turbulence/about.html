<p>
Some elements of the world we live in seem less than natural. 
Many of these elements are known as rumors; a few, upon gaining a certain notability, graduate to a more fitting term: &ldquo;legends.&rdquo; 
</p>

<p>
There are two kinds of legends. Some are untrue; there's no need to believe those. 
Others, however, are the ones you don't want to think about, not because they're dangerous, 
but because if there's even a chance they're true, you will have to rethink everything about your life, 
from the moment you came into being to your day-to-day tasks in the present. 
</p>

<p>
At times you might see a green-tinted glimmer on the horizon, or come across artifacts that let you see things that others dismiss as urban fantasy. 
You may find yourself standing on a makeshift base between realities, or drafted to hunt down the last of the undead in the heart of Australia. 
Of course, you could keep yourself from worrying about these, relying on the reasonable chance that you won't need to pay heed to them&#8230; but don't count on it.
</p>

<p>
Welcome to a world where the most mundane of items seems subject to suspicion. Welcome to a place where knowledge will help you but never guarantees your safety. 
Welcome to a land where hope seems unreachable&#8230; but might be hiding just beneath the surface.
</p>

<p>Welcome to Turbulence.
