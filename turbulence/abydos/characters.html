	<h1>Nephthys (Chloe Hunter)</h1>
	<h2>Portrayed by: Leena Valtapaz</h2>
	<p>
		Chloe views herself as a detective of sorts, prizing answers above all else. While she can follow orders well, she prefers spontaneity and is very competent on her own. 
		While she can be a bit jittery at times, she's practiced to be pretty good at not letting it show. 
		Fast at learning, a little sarcastic and eager to look on the bright side of things, she is nonetheless aware that no one lives forever, 
		and that some elements of her past don’t seem to add up.  
	</p>

<div class="pldiv1 c6"></div>
<div class="char c4">
	<h1>Ma'at</h1>
	<h2>Portrayed by: Klenda Valtapaz</h2>
	<p>
		ABYDOS' battle-hardened research expert, Ma'at is never one to dumb down anything. A collected but often fierce fighter, 
		she wants to help others, and will say whatever needs to be said to do so&mdash;often at the expense of pleasantries. 
		While some have proposed that she has a slight sense of humor and recognizes how her words come off, everyone's been smart enough so far to avoid asking her if it's true. 
	</p>

<div class="canvasBlock cA" id="Anhur">
<div class="pldiv1 c7"></div>
<div class="char c4">
	<h1>Anhur</h1>
	<h2>Portrayed by: Mxyl Valtapaz</h2>
	<p>
		The engineer who put the finishing touches on ABYDOS' team transport, Anhur prefers to be out in the action, and his fighting skills justify his preference. 
		Despite being fairly friendly, he can act pretty harsh at first glance, with little time or patience for questions once he feels too many are asked of him. 
		He carries some emotional weight from a previous encounter with the Lights, and while he prefers to keep fighting to keep his mind off it, 
		his past can lead him to act somewhat rashly despite trying to give a calm and collected demeanor. 
	</p>

<div class="canvasBlock cD" id="Djebauti">
<div class="pldiv1 c6"></div>
<div class="char c4">
	<h1>Djebauti</h1>
	<h2>Portrayed by: Zorg Valtapaz</h2>
	<p>
		Djebauti carries an ethereal wisdom, despite being one of the most social and amiable people in ABYDOS. 
		He was voted in as ABYDOS' leader without his say, but he tries to make the most of his position and never abuses it, 
		preferring to address his fellow teammates as friends rather than subordinates while still willing to correct them when necessary. 
		His past is mysterious, especially his ability to feel the Lights&mdash;he feels uncomfortable when they're active, 
		but he also feels strangely at home when he's within the lights&#8230; a fact he is well aware of.
