	<h1>If you follow me, <em>you will die.</em></h1>
	<p>
		At certain horizons, a brief flash of green may catch the eye. It won't be a subtle flash; it never is. 
		These flashes are rarely reported on in media&mdash;it's not that people don't see it, but that those who do don't tend to tell the tale. 
		Many who see the Lights don't find anything wrong or unnatural about the phenomena at first; in fact, they're not even frightened. 
	</p>
	<p>
		And that's where it begins.

	<h1>The Lights are real. <em>Ignore the Lights.</em></h1>
	<p>
		The Lights have an enticing presence, drawing many who see them closer. 
		The only possibility for survival is to ignore them and pretend you didn't see them. 
		However, this is becoming more difficult: since their first appearances, the Lights have been expanding, 
		growing dramatically in scale and frequency of appearance within the last twelve years. 
		Were one to resist the Lights but otherwise attract their attention, they become targets pinpointed by the assassins of the Lights: 
		tall, shriveled humanoid creatures that would stop at nothing to destroy whoever the Lights deem a potential threat.

	<h1>We are the only, true defense. <br/><em>We stand a chance.</em></h1>
	<p>
		The situation changed significantly when several men and women, who had each survived experiences with the Lights and encounters with their assassins, found one another and banded together. 
		They realized that there was nowhere on Earth where they could hide from the assassins&#8230; so they discovered how to hide outside it. 
		Through long periods of innovation, experimentation and survival on the run, the group found a way to travel to the inner structure of the universe itself, 
		then worked to build a base of operations within it. 
	</p>
	<p>
		A base named ABYDOS.
