	<h1>The Project</h1>
	<p>
		As with much of Turbulence, my goals with this long-term project didn't begin with the concept of a good project so much as a better one&mdash;one 
		that stretches our narrative to the point where visual effects are hardly the project's primary focus. 
		When the project entered its early planning stages in early 2015, I'd already done some work in visual effects, 
		although most of it was simply recording short, one-shot scenes and adding special effects after the fact. 
		In fact, it was within months of publishing my first video to utilize both multiple camera angles and conflict-driven narrative 
		that I began writing the first draft of the <i>#36</i> script and story bible. 
		One could say that the project exists to do four main things: 
	</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Expand on my existing visual effects abilities by adding storytelling, strong characters and further worldbuilding</li>
		<li>Explore concepts such as objective vs. ends-justified morality in a darker world</li>
		<li>Provide a new way for family and friends to get together and have fun</li>
		<li>Create a cast of fun, rounded characters</li>
	</ol>
	<p>
		<i>ABYDOS</i> and its upcoming sequel primarily focused on being story-driven, being my first outings into narrative filmmaking. 
		In <i>#36</i>, I'd like the characters to take center stage, both moving the story forward and being fun to watch. 
	</p>
	<hr />
	<h1>The Story</h1>
	<p>
		At the core of <i>#36</i> is the struggle between utilitarianism and objective morality. 
		SASTI operate within an ends-justified system, in which anything for the greater good of Earth's safety is authorized, but some members within SASTI are divided on what the best way truly is. 
		Before SASTI were anything else, they were&mdash;and still are&mdash;an espionage group, complete with all the ethical questions such a group brings with it. 
		The series raises questions about societal evolution and whether morally gray problems have only equally gray answers. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The series began with this concept, if a fairly simplified version at first; for quite a while, however, 
		its primary emphasis was on superpowered beings (SASTI stood for the Superhuman, rather than Supernatural, and Advance Science and Technology Investigation program during this time). 
		This period came to an end when I realized that a spy series starring superheroes already existed elsewhere, 
		although it was only when my brother and fellow creator Zorg and I decided to merge my world with his more fantasy-influenced universe that I felt free to incorporate more ideas into the story. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The story itself it motivated primarily by SASTI's members, particularly by those struggling with SASTI's reaction to the abnatural (shorthand for what SASTI investigates) crisis. 
		As complications arise, several of SASTI's agents begin to raise questions beyond only ethical ones: 
		SASTI's most closely guarded project, known only as #36, has been deployed. As tension grows both within the group and from exterior threats, 
		what begins as a subgroup convinced that there are better ways than SASTI's becomes a team dedicated to gathering information on #36.
