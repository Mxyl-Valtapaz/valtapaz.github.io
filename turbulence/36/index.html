		The Supernatural and Advanced Science and Technology Investigation program, abbreviated as SASTI, was initiated in 1989 by a global organization above the Illuminati, 
		with the established goal of monitoring&mdash;and, if necessary, interfering with&mdash;the activities of beings with uncanny abilities. 
		This included humans who would craft technology decades or even centuries ahead of our time, 
		in addition to those utilizing abilities outside the plane of human understanding. 
		<!--Humans crafting technology decades or even centuries, in addition to those utilizing abilities outside the plane of human understanding, 
		had become slowly more common since the first instances were recorded in the 1920s, 
		and the situation had grown far enough that a new branch of the organization was formed to deal with the potential threat: SASTI.-->

		SASTI established its independence in 1995. It was intentionally disassociated from its parent organization, 
		which had no intent of repeating the mistakes that had revealed the U.S. National Security Agency to the public eye, 
		and was made to seem as independent as possible, with its own organized hierarchy. 

		The third leader of SASTI agreed with this philosophy of secrecy, 
		though he also saw that SASTI's remaining links to its parent organization were impairing their ability to solve the abnatural crisis. 
		SASTI's independence enabled it to sever itself by force from the group that created it, freeing the leader to order an accelerated deployment of SASTI projects and operations.

		Various studies had revealed extraordinary links between instances of technological might and global crime, 
		and	instances of stranger powers had never found a single case that didn't end in extreme danger&mdash;occasionally to Earth itself. This led to a drastic change of tactics: 
		whenever an extranatural or unnaturally ingenious threat would be found, such a threat was to be neutralized by whichever means were deemed necessary. 
	</p>

	<p>
		As a result, SASTI have partially expanded their projects beyond these beings, into areas that would normally be taken on by other branches of its now-crippled parent group; 
		it has searched for and located objects potentially related to extraterrestrial life or even time travel, 
		and has also worked to a degree on mysterious lights that could sometimes be seen on certain horizons.
